## 🛠️ Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13 (or 3.10+)
- Basic Python knowledge
- Understanding of APIs (helpful but not required)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd myproject
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up API keys (you'll need at least one):
```bash
# Create a .env file
cp .env.example .env

# Add your API keys:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
# Or for free alternatives:
# HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

## 📖 How to Use This Tutorial

1. **Start with Lesson 1** and work through sequentially
2. **Read the theory** in each lesson markdown file
3. **Run the code examples** to see concepts in action
4. **Experiment** with the examples and modify them
5. **Build your own** RAG system for your use case

## 🎓 Learning Tips

- **Take your time**: RAG combines multiple complex concepts
- **Run every code example**: Hands-on practice is crucial
- **Experiment**: Modify parameters and see what happens
- **Build projects**: Apply what you learn to real problems
- **Ask questions**: Open issues if something isn't clear

## 📊 What is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation** is a technique that enhances large language models by giving them access to external knowledge. Instead of relying solely on their training data, RAG systems:

1. **Retrieve** relevant information from a knowledge base
2. **Augment** the LLM's prompt with this information
3. **Generate** accurate, grounded responses

This solves key problems like:
- ✅ Hallucinations (making up facts)
- ✅ Outdated information
- ✅ Lack of domain-specific knowledge
- ✅ Inability to cite sources

## 🌟 Why RAG Matters

RAG has become the standard approach for:
- **Customer support chatbots**: Answer from company documentation
- **Research assistants**: Search through papers and documents
- **Enterprise search**: Query internal knowledge bases
- **Personal assistants**: Access your notes and files
- **Legal/Medical AI**: Ground responses in verified sources

## 🔧 Technology Stack

This tutorial uses:
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **OpenAI/Anthropic APIs**: For embeddings and LLMs (with free alternatives)
- **ChromaDB**: Vector database (simple, local, no setup)
- **LangChain** (optional): Framework for building LLM apps
- **Sentence Transformers**: Free, open-source embeddings
